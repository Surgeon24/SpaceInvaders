Space Invaders is a text based arcade game, 
that make a reference to the game series of 
the same title, taking best moment from those games
and adapting it to modern realities.

* features that are implemented
* features that are planned
* design patterns
* code smells

Couldn't find how to change the size of the screen, so for 
now it 80x24. Also, we probably should use global variable 
for the size of the screen. For now, it's duplicated in 
every class.
